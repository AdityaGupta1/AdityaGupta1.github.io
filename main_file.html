<h1>RedFrog404's Minecraft Forge 1.8 Tutorials</h1>

<h2>Main File</h2>

<p class="goal">Goal: Create the main file, which will be Forge's entry point into your mod.</p>

To start off with modding, you will need a main file. This file is basically where Forge starts when it is loading your mod. It contains information like the unique mod ID, the version of the mod, and what to do before, during, and after initialization. Before you make this file, you will need a new package. A package is like a folder, and it can store many different files. This package can be named whatever you want, but recommended package naming conventions say that all letters should be lowercase. You can't use any spaces or special characters, but you can use periods. In this tutorial, all of my packages will start with "org.redfrog404.spooky.scary.skeletons" to follow along with the code at my <a href="http://www.bit.ly/spooky-scary-skeletons">GitHub repository</a>.
<br><br>
To make the new package, first expand your Minecraft folder by clicking on the gray arrow next to it. You should see a folder inside named "src/main/java". This is where all of your source code will go. Right click on the folder and from the menu, select "New > Package". A window will pop up asking what you want to name your package. As said before, you can name it whatever you want, but it is recommended to stick with the naming conventions. Once you have entered the name, click on "Finish".
<br><br>
Now that you have made your package, the "src/main/java" folder will expand, and you will see your package inside. It will have a grayed-out icon, meaning that there is nothing inside at the moment.
