<h2>Main File</h2>

<p class="goal">Goal: Create the main file, which will be Forge's entry point into your mod.</p>

To start off with modding, you will need a main file. This file is basically where Forge starts when it is loading your mod. It contains information like the unique mod ID, the version of the mod, and what to do before, during, and after initialization. Before you make this file, you will need a new package. A package is like a folder, and it can store many different files. This package can be named whatever you want, but recommended package naming conventions say that all letters should be lowercase. You can't use any spaces or special characters, but you can use periods. In this tutorial, all of my packages will start with <tt>org.redfrog404.spooky.scary.skeletons"</tt> to follow along with the code at my <a href="http://www.bit.ly/spooky-scary-skeletons">GitHub repository</a>.

<br><br>

To make the new package, first expand your Minecraft folder by clicking on the gray arrow next to it. You should see a folder inside named "src/main/java". This is where all of your source code will go. Right click on the folder and from the menu, select "New > Package". A window will pop up asking what you want to name your package. As said before, you can name it whatever you want, but it is recommended to stick with the naming conventions. Once you have entered the name, click on "Finish".

<br><br>

Now that you have made your package, the "src/main/java" folder will expand, and you will see your package inside. It will have a grayed-out icon, meaning that there is nothing inside at the moment. Now, you need to add the main file. Right click on your new package and select "New > Class". A window will pop up, and there will be lots of things you can configure. However, the only thing we are worried about is the name of the class. Its name can be anything you want; this tutorial will be using the name <tt>Spooky</tt>. Naming conventions state that class names should start with capital letters, and each new word should be capital as well. For example, <tt>SpookyScarySkeletons</tt> would fit into the conventions while <tt>spookyscaryskeletons</tt> or <tt>spooky_scary_skeletons</tt> wouldn't. Your new class, once created, should look like:

<br><br>

<div class="codetop">Main.java</div>
<br>
<div class="codebox">package org.redfrog404.spooky.scary.skeletons;

public class Main{
	
}</div>

<br>

Right now, it doesn't do anything. You will need to add some more things before the file is ready. The following code is what you will need to add to make your main file ready:

<br><br>

<div class="codetop">
Main.java
</div>
<br>
<div class="codebox">package org.redfrog404.spooky.scary.skeletons;

import net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Mod;
import net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Mod.EventHandler;
import net.minecraftforge.fml.common.event.FMLInitializationEvent;

@Mod(modid = Spooky.MODID, version = Spooky.VERSION)
public class Main {

	public static final String MODID = "Spooky";
	public static final String VERSION = "1.0.0";

	@EventHandler
	public void init(FMLInitializationEvent event){

	}
}</div>

<br>

The first line says that this file is in the package <tt>org.redfrog404.spooky.scary.skeletons</tt>. The next three lines are "importing" other classes for use in this one. The line starting with <tt>@Mod</tt> is an annotation line that tells Forge to look for this file as a main file. It also gives Forge the mod ID and version, which are defined in the two lines after the next one. The line that says <tt>public class Main {</tt> is saying that the class name is <tt>Main</tt>. The next two lines define constants to represent the mod ID and version. Finally, the next four lines make up a method which will run when Forge initializes. This is where most of the magic happens. From there, all of your blocks, items, mobs, etc. are registered.

<br><br>

That's it for the main file! Now that you are done with this important tutorial, you can move on to fun stuff like new blocks.
