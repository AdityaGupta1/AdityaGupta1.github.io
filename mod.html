<h1>Spooky Scary Skeletons - A Minecraft Forge 1.8 Mod</h1>

This page is all about my Minecraft Forge 1.8 mod, Spooky Scary Skeletons! 
<br><br>
This mod is an adventure mod that adds a lot of new gameplay, such as new blocks, items, tools, armor, swords, guns, bows, entities, bosses, dimensions, etc. using the theme of bones, skeletons, and (slightly) creepy things. A full list of mod features, as well as a link to mod installation instructions, can be found on this page.

<b>Mod Features</b>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>New Items:</b> The mod includes regular items like ingots and materials, but the important items introduced in the mod are bones. There are different tiers of bones, starting with Tier I and going to Tier III. As the tier gets higher, the tools and materials that you can craft get better. The bones are made from many different materials, and they can be used to craft tools and weapons. They are essential to the gameplay of this mod.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Blocks:</b> Ores, mineral blocks, and portals are all part of this mod. There are lots of ores, and one of the most important is the Box o' Bones. This ore is used for crafting a lot of the bones. There are also other ores like Jade, Purplonium, and Zinc. There is even a Dimensional Gateway block that teleports you to other dimensions!</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Tools, Swords, Bows, Guns, and Staves:</b> Spooky Scary Skeletons adds lots of new weapons. Each tier of bones adds a new sword, pickaxe, axe, and shovel. There are also other tools, like the Radioactive set or the Sword of the Ancients.<br> The mod adds many new weapons as well. There are guns, which use certain items for ammuntion, and do considerable damage. Then, there are new bows like the Double Bow and Ender Crossbow. Lastly, there are staves like the Staff of the Incinerator, which shoots out fireballs that summon lava.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Armor:</b> The mod currently only adds two new sets of armor, but more are planned for the future. The armor sets sometimes give you special effects, like higher jumping. They are also considerably better than current armors, and even better than diamond sometimes.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Mobs:</b> Spooky Scary Skeletons adds a few new mobs, such as the Risen Dead, Skeletal Cow, and Jelly Skull. Some of them will try to kill you, while others will be waiting for you to kill them. Many more mobs are planned for the future, because what is an adventure mod without tons of mobs?</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Boss:</b> The mod adds one new boss mob as of now. The boss is known as The Incinerator, and has 600 health (twice the health of a wither). It has a fireball attack, a lightning attack, and a plain old punch attack. It drops many good items like the Staff of the Incinerator and the Transforming Staff of the Inferno.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Biomes and Dimensions:</b> Currently, the mod adds one new dimension and biome, with more planned for the future. The Spooky Sands biome and dimension contain the Jelly Skull and the Skeletal Cow, as well as Calcified Stone. Calcified Stone is an ore that you need to make the item that summons The Incinerator. The dimension is accessed by right clicking on a Dimensional Gateway with a Tier I Bone Key.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>New Potion Effects and Enchantments:</b> Lastly, Spooky Scary Skeletons adds new potion effects and enchantments. Curse is the only new potion effect currently, and it is like a more deadly poison effect. There are three enchantments: Haste, Dismemberment, and Venomous. Haste makes bow pullback time faster, Dismemberment drops a bone whenever you hurt a mob, and Venomous applies poison to whatever you hit.</li>
</ul>

<b>Downloading and installing the mod</b>
<br><br>
Overall, the mod enhances normal gameplay and is really fun to play. The mod source code and its downloads can be found at <a href="http://www.bit.ly/spooky-scary-skeletons">bit.ly/spooky-scary-skeletons</a>. A tutorial on how to install mods with Forge (which I didn't make) can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k53Bn4RAUKA">here</a>. The tutorial may look outdated, but the instructions have stayed the same from 1.6.4 to 1.8.8.
